# Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

This repository is a collection of basic machine learning algorithms, implemented as exercises from *Data Science from Scratch with Python* by Joel Grus. Each Python file focuses on a different fundamental machine learning concept or technique, providing practical, readable implementations suitable for study and experimentation.


### Key Files

Each Python file in the `src` directory is a standalone module implementing foundational concepts and algorithms used in machine learning and data science:

- **Data Handling**: `getting_data.py`, `working_with_data.py`
- **Statistical Methods**: `statistics_ds.py`, `probability.py`
- **Basic Algorithms**: `clustering.py`, `k_nearest_neighbors.py`, `naive_bayes.py`, `recommender_systems.py`
- **Linear Models**: `simple_linear_regression.py`, `multiple_regression.py`, `logistic_regression.py`
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: `neural_networks.py`, `deep_learning.py`
- **Optimization**: `gradient_descent.py`
- **Natural Language Processing**: `natural_language_processing.py`

## Requirements

All code examples are written in Python and use only basic libraries such as `math` and `random`, to stay as close as possible to the pure Python implementation style presented in *Data Science from Scratch*.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore individual files to understand specific algorithms. You can execute each file directly or import modules into other Python scripts as required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name/src
python3 decision_trees.py  # Run a specific module
```
